# My Machine Learning Repository

## Overview

This repository contains two main scripts for machine learning tasks: one for regression and another for classification. These scripts allow users to train, evaluate, and make predictions using various models and datasets.

## Contents

- `regressor.py`: A script for training and evaluating regression models. It supports multiple regression algorithms and includes options for hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation metrics.
- `classifier.py`: A script for training and evaluating classification models. It supports various classification algorithms and includes options for model selection and performance evaluation.

## Features

### Regressor

- Supports common regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest)
- Performs hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation
- Evaluates models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared
- Provides visualizations of model performance, including prediction plots and residuals

### Classifier

- Supports various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest)
- Includes cross-validation for model selection
- Evaluates models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC
- Generates confusion matrices and ROC curves for model evaluation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
